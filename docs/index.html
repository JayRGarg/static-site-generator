    <article><div><h1>YOU ARE THE MEDICINE</h1><p><img src="/static-site-generator/images/logo.png" alt="Logo"></img></p><h2>CONSCIOUSNESS COACHING INFUSED WITH REIKI ENERGY</h2><p>Our Philosophy</p><p>At You Are The Medicine, I believe that true wellness is a holistic approach that encompasses the mind, body, and spirit. As your guide, I strive to empower my clients to take control of their own health and well-being. By integrating the magic of Reiki energy healing and Shamanic Journies through guidance, I support individuals unlocking their inner potential and realizing that the medicine is right there within them and has been all along. You are not broken, there's nothing to fix. My mission is to guide you in harnessing this inner power, fostering a deep connection to your self-healing capabilities and promoting a balanced, vibrant life.</p><p>You are the solution you seek. I am here to be a light and reflection along the journey with you, to meet your highest and most authentic version of yourself. BE STILL AND KNOW, I AM.</p><h2>ABOUT ME</h2><h4>HELLO</h4><p>My name is Shereen.  I am a Reiki Master and Consciousness Coach.</p><p>I work with the Sacred Energy of Reiki along with Angels and Guides. These spiritual support beings present themselves to me while I am focusing my attention on your individual and unique energy.</p><p>I have a deep calling and passion to be of service to the planet. I believe this is possible through the healing of humanity and regulated nervous systems. Through embodiment work and creating new neurological pathways by shifting limiting beliefs by using breathwork and tapping techniques. Raising the vibration of Mother Earth is my mission. That mission begins with your desire and openness to receive a deeper expansion of your consciousness and well-being.  Experiencing Reiki allows you to operate at a higher vibrational frequency. This elevated state is achieved through deep relaxation, guided meditation, and directed breath work. As a certified Usui Reiki Master Teacher practitioner, I am the channel through which the energy flows. With my guidance, the combination of these simple practices releases the blocked and stagnant energy that is being held in your chakra system. This allows your body, mind, and spirit to heal on a deeper cellular level.   For more information about the chakras, click here.</p><p>Are you ready to heal and co-create your freedom?
